      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The Philadelphia Eagles were established in 1933 and have since become one of the most iconic franchises in the NFL. The team has won multiple championships, including the Super Bowl LII victory in 2018 against the New England Patriots. The Eagles are known for their passionate fan base and their fierce rivalries, particularly with the Dallas Cowboys. The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football team based in Philadelphia. The Eagles compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Lincoln Financial Field in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.[7]

        The franchise was established in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets when a group led by Bert Bell secured the rights to an NFL franchise in Philadelphia. Since their formation, the Eagles have appeared in the playoffs 31 times, won 16 division titles (including 13 in the NFC East), appeared in four pre-merger NFL Championship Games, winning three of them (1948, 1949, and 1960), and appeared in five Super Bowls, winning Super Bowl LII at the end of the 2017 season.
        
        As of 2025, 14 individuals affiliated with the Eagles have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Eric Allen, Chuck Bednarik, Bert Bell, Bob Brown, Harold Carmichael, Brian Dawkins, Sonny Jurgensen, Greasy Neale, Tommy McDonald, Pete Pihos, Norm Van Brocklin, Steve Van Buren, Dick Vermeil, and Reggie White.
        
        The team's intense rivalry with the New York Giants has been ranked the top rivalry of all time by NFL Network, the fourth-best NFL rivalry by Sports Illustrated,[8] and one of the fiercest and best-known football rivalries by ESPN.[9] The Eagles' bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys has become more high-profile and intense since the 1960s, and the team has a historic rivalry with the Washington Commanders. Their rivalry with the Pittsburgh Steelers dates back to 1933 and is known as the "Battle of Pennsylvania".[10]
        
        The Philadelphia Eagles rank among the best teams in the NFL for attendance and have sold out every home game continuously since the 1999 season.[11][12]
        
        The Eagles are owned by Jeffrey Lurie, who bought the team in 1994 for $185 million.[13] In December 2024, the Eagles became one of the first teams in the NFL to sell an ownership stake to outside investors. The deal sold 8% of the franchise at a valuation of $8.3 billion.[13]</p>
